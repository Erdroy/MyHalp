MyHalp - Unity3D helper library.

Feel free to contribute, it's all free, do anything you want with this code, but do not distibute in any other form.

 - MyJobQueue - Queued jobs with progress.
 - MyDispatcher - Call any method from any thread(1 frame of delay).
 - MyColor - Simple color structure, can be serialized cuz it's a struct.
 - MyComponent - Custom Unity behaviour class.
 - MyLogger - Log file creating helper, MyLogger.Add("Wouw, LOGS!");
 - Some extensions for math and other classes.

Features that are under development:
 - Math - MyVector2/3/4, MyQuaternion, MyMatrix/3x3/4x4 and some more.
 
Planned features:
