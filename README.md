MyHalp - Unity3D helper library.

Feel free to contribute, it's all free, do anything you want with this code, but do not distibute in any other form.
Initialy it was created to be used with our game, MurderShadow, but we decided to share some code.

Features:
 - MyInput - Custom Input class that supports binding, FixedUpdate(via .FixedGet) and more.
 - MyJob - Threaded jobs.
 - MyJobQueue - Queued jobs with progress.
 - MyObjectPool - Pooled objects, request 'new' gameobject without performace hit at any time.
 - MyDispatcher - Call any method/deleate from any thread in the main thread - Wow! What a great thing.
 - MyColor - Simple color structure, can be serialized cuz it's a struct.
 - MyComponent - Custom Unity behaviour class.
 - MyLogger - Log file creating helper, MyLogger.Add("Wouw, LOGS!");
 - MyInstancer - Creates new instance of given component, and assings it to a gameobject.
 - Some extensions for math and other classes.
 - Math - MyVector2/3/4, MyQuaternion, MyMatrix/3x3/4x4 and much more(using SharpDX.Mathematics).

Features that 'are' under development:
 - MyAudio - Allows to play loooots of audio clips at the same time.
 
Planned features:
 - MyEvent - custom delegate handlers.
 - MyConsole - class for handling Windows console window.
 - MyRCon - Remote control, command line(server + GUI client).
